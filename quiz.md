## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
Business applications are constructed utilizing software components called as services under service-oriented architecture, or SOA. Services can communicate with each other in a variety of languages and platforms and provide a range of business operations.    
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Standardize service control: The standard helps the user use the service. It is essential that service users are able to access these specifications. Portals for discovery, like MuleSoft Exchange Anypoint Platform or MuleSoft API Community Manager, offer a comprehensive method for documenting and sharing the requirements and capabilities for service usage.

-Loose Coupling: One of the key benefits of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the flexibility it offers customers when dealing with providers that support them through services. A ticketing system and a client app are put in opposition to each other by a service, which breaks their dependency and disconnects them. 

-Reusability: Reusability generates a flywheel that fosters innovation. Assist groups in locating current services before creating new ones. Encouraging the adoption of reusability requires informing customers about what is presently available. To address this specific need, MuleSoft Exchange and API Community Manager offer state-of-the-art solutions.   
3. Define Microservices.
Software created with the microservices architectural and organizational framework consists of independent, separate services that communicate with one another through well-defined application programming interfaces. These services are owned by small, autonomous teams.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Microservices are an approach to building applications consisting of multiple small, independent services.
Microservices in Java refer to a software architecture pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services.
Enterprises like Amazon, Netflix, Uber, and Etsy have adopted microservices to achieve scaling advantages, business agility, and profitability.
Microservices offer benefits such as agility, pluggability, scalability, and the ability to adapt to changing business requirements.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
In an SOA model, services or modules are shared and reused enterprise-wide, whereas a microservice architecture is built on individual services that function independently. In other words, SOA has an enterprise scope, while microservices has an application scope.
6. Define Web Services.
Web services are a type of internet software that use standardized messaging protocols and are made available from an application service provider's web server for use by a client or other web-based programs.
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
Exposing the Existing Function on the network. A web service is a unit of managed code that can be remotely  invoked using HTTP. That is, it can be activated using HTTP 
requests. 
Interoperability Web services allow various applications to talk to each other and share data and services among themselves. Other applications can also use web services. 
Standardized Protocol Web services use standardized industry-standard protocol for  communication
Low Cost Communication Web services use SOAP over HTTP protocol, so you can use  your existing low-cost internet for implementing web services. 
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
XML-Based Web services use XML at data representation and data transportation layers. Using XML eliminates any networking, operating system, or platform binding.
Loosely Coupled A consumer of a web service is not tied to that web service  directly. The web service interface can change over time without  compromising the client's ability to interact with the service.
Coarse-Grained Object-oriented technologies such as Java expose their services  through individual methods. An individual method is to find an operation to provide any useful capability at a corporate level. 
Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous Synchronicity refers to the binding of the client to the execution of the service.
Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) Web services allow clients to invoke procedures, functions, and  methods on remote objects using an XML-based protocol. 
Supports Document Exchange One of the key advantages of XML is its generic way of  representing not only data but also complex documents. These  documents can be as simple as representing a current address,  or they can be as complex as representing an entire book or Request for Quotation (RFQ). 
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
The provider creates the web service and makes it available to client applications who want to use it. Requestor is nothing but the client application 
that needs to contact a web service. The client application can be a .Net, Java, or any other language-based application which looks for some sort of functionality via a web service.Broker -The broker is nothing but the application which provides access to the UDDI.
Publish A provider informs the broker (service registry) about the existence of the web service by using the broker's publish interface to make the service accessible to clients Find the requestor consults the broker to locate a published web service Bind With the information it gained from the broker (service registry) about the web service, the requestor is able to bind, or invoke, the web service.
10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
SOAP is an XML-based protocol for exchanging information between  computers.
WSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services and how to access them.
WSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services and how to access them.
